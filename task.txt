Build a FastAPI based "survey tool" that has a questionnaire of 15 questions. The survey should collect basic user info and then the responses for those questions.
The questionnaire itself, and the response from each user should be stored in the database.
No frontend needed. Just use tools like Postman/Insomnia/curl to store the responses
